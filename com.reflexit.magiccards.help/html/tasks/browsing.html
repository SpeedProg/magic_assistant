<h1>Browsing Cards</h1>
To browse Magic cards you would need <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info</a> and 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewmagicdb">MTG Database</a> views.
<p/>
MTG Database View shows all available cards. By default it will only
show one instance of a card with the same name for the latest edition.
Cards for older editions can be downloaded from the internet, see <a href="updatingdb.html">updating database</a> section.
<p/>
Card details and scanned card picture are shown in the <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info</a> view.
It shows card image if available (downloads it from internet), and also shows card name, description and type below the image. 
Click on the card in any of the tables to see card info in this view. See more details in <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info View</a> 
reference.

<h2>Sorting</h2>
You can sort by any column by clicking on the column header in the views that display card tables.
If you click again sorting order is reversed. You can also see more columns, control is available from "Preferences..."
menu of the view menu <img src="../screenshots/icons/view_menu.gif" alt="triangle button"/>.

<h2>Filtering</h2>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.
<p/>
Currently filter dialog has the following pages: Basic Filter, Sets Filter and Location filter (only for My Cards view).
 
<p/>
Items that belong to the same group (such as Color) would be selected using logical OR. 
Items that belong to different groups would be selected using logical AND.
<p/>
For example and you select colour Blue and White and Type Creature and Enchantment, 
you will get all creatures and all enchantments that are Blue or White (including multicolors).
<p/>
See details in 
<a href="../reference/filter_dialog.html">Filter Dialog</a> reference.

<h2>Search</h2>
You can bring up search control using Ctrl-F key or using view menu "Find...".
It allows you to find a card in the view by name (or part of name). 
Found card will be automatically selected. 
<br/>
You can also type first letter of each word in a card name as uppercase,
for example if you type "ESMB" it should match with "Endrek Sahr, Master Breeder". 
<p/>
See details in 
<a href="../reference/search_bar.html">Search Bar</a> reference.

<h2>Other Actions</h2>
Some other actions available from main menu, context menu (right click) or from view menu (triangle button in the view header  <img src="../screenshots/icons/view_menu.gif" alt="triangle button"/>).
See also <a href="../reference/views.html#viewmagicdb">MTG Database View</a> reference.
<p/>
You can changes layout of your views but dragging them around by the header. If you get lost you can reset to original layout using 
menu "Window-&gt;Reset Perspective..."
