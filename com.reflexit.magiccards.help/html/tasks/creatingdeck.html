<h1>Creating and Populating a Deck or Collection</h1>

The following tasks describing how to create and populate a Deck. For collection use same procedure but replace
word Deck with word Collection (until end of the turn).

<h2><a name="#create_deck">Create a new Deck</a></h2>
To create a deck:
<li>Open a <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcardnav">Card Navigator</a>View by clicking on its header.</li>
<li>Select a parent Deck folder.</li> 
<li>Select New...-&gt; Deck from the context menu (Right click).</li>
<li>Type a name of the deck in the Name field. Click Finish. </li>

Empty deck will be automatically open.

<h2><a name="#populate_manual">Populate a deck from printed cards</a></h2>
<p/>
This is procedure of how to populate a deck from the printed cards deck. If you have your deck in electronic format you 
may choose to use a <a href="#import_deck">deck import</a> instead.
<p/>
To populate a deck.
<li>Open a new empty deck, by double clicking on it in the <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcardnav">Card Navigator</a>View. 
Deck view should open in the top part of the window</li>
<li>Activate a <a href="../reference/views.html#viewmagicdb">MTG Database</a> View. It should open in the bottom of the window. 
If deck and database view overlap each other drag one or another up to 
make sure they arrange properly.</li>
<li>Activate Card Info view to see card image. It should be on the left</li>
<li> 
If your deck is made from limited number of sets, it is better to select them in the filter,
to simplify the search. To do that click on Filter button on the view header (Or select Filter... from view or context menu),
switch to Set Filter on the left and select one or more sets. 
</li>
<li>
Now type Ctrl-F or select Find... from the view menu (triangle button in the view header). <a href="../reference/search_bar.html#search">Search panel</a> will be open.
</li>

<li>
Type name of card in the search field, you don't have to type whole name, search would show up cards as you type.
If card name consists of several words, you can type only first letters of each word in capital letters, for example
to find "Shield of the Righteous" type SOTR in the search field. If it is not your card you can keep typing until full name
is typed or press Enter to cycle through search results. 
</li>
<li>If you have filter by sets enabled and card is not found, it may be because by default database contains only latest print of the same
card, if you want exact set for you card you need to update database with this set. See <a href="../tasks/updatingdb.html">Updating database</a>.
<li> 
When can is found press "+" button (Or select Add to Active Deck from context menu Or Drag a card to your deck). 
Card will be added to your deck.
</li>
<li>
If you want to enter number of cards (card count) you can either press "+" several times to achieve needed number, 
or double click on card in the deck and edit count of cards directly. You also can edit count in the Count cell itself.
</li>

<h2><a name="import_deck">Populate a deck using import</a></h2>
<h3>Importing from text format</h3>
If you have a deck content in an electronic form you can import it using Deck import.
Select a new empty deck and select Import... from a context menu (right click menu).
Select a file or clipboard option and press Next. Select "Deck Classic" as a format. 
You will see a preview of your deck import.
Click Finish to finish the importing. 
<p/>
Example 1 (Deck Classic, Count last):
<pre>
Diabolic Tutor (Tenth Edition) x4
Quagmire Druid x 3
</pre>
<p/>
Example 2 (Deck Classic, Count first):
<pre>
4 x Diabolic Tutor 
3 x Quagmire Druid
</pre>
<h3>Importing from csv format or excel</h3>
If you have you cards in excel you can import them in the Magic Assistant deck or collection.
To do that, first re-arrange the columns to match the following order:
<pre>
ID,NAME,COST,TYPE,POWER,TOUGHNESS,ORACLE,SET,RARITY,DBPRICE,LANG,COUNT,PRICE,COMMENT,LOCATION,CUSTOM,OWNERSHIP
</pre>
This is actually Magic Assistant CSV export format.  
The only columns which are used are NAME, SET and user data such as COUNT, PRICE and COMMENT.
All columns except NAME can be empty, but they still must present to keep the order.
Export data from excel into .csv file with "," separator and import it into Magic Assistant.
When importing select "CSV" format. 
If data file has header row check "Data has a header row" checkbox, otherwise uncheck it.
Preview would show if format is matching.

<p/>
Example 3 (CSV format, no header row):
<pre>
,Diabolic Tutor,,,,,,Tenth Edition,,,,4,1.99,Signed by Artist,
,Quagmire Druid,,,,,,Apocalypse,,,,2,0.15,,
,Swamp,,,,,,Tenth Edition,,,,16,0.15,,
</pre>
Example 4 (CSV format, header row):
<pre>
ID,NAME,COST,TYPE,POWER,TOUGHNESS,ORACLE,SET,RARITY,DBPRICE,LANG,COUNT,PRICE,COMMENT,LOCATION,CUSTOM,OWNERSHIP
129525,Diabolic Tutor,{2}{B}{B},Sorcery,,,Search your library for a card and put that card into your hand. Then shuffle your library.,Tenth Edition,Uncommon,1.99,,4,0.0,,,,false
27188,Quagmire Druid,{2}{B},Creature - Zombie Druid,2,2,"{G}, {T}, Sacrifice a creature: Destroy target enchantment.",Apocalypse,Common,0.15,,2,0.0,,,,false
129757,Swamp,,Basic Land - Swamp,,,[B],Tenth Edition,BasicLand,0.15,,16,0.0,,Decks/Thrull Breader & Demon.xml,,false
</pre>
Note that for CSV format if field has "," it is it has to be in quotes.
<p/>
Piped Table format is the same as CSV but using | as separator and ignoring the quotes.
<p> 
Example 5 (Table Piped format, no header row):
<pre>
|Diabolic Tutor||||||Tenth Edition||||4
|Quagmire Druid||||||Apocalypse||||2
</pre>
