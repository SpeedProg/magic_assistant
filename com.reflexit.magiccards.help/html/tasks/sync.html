<h1>Setting up cloud sync or version control</h1>

Easiest way to sync the data would be create a workspace in the directory which is automatically
synced with cloud, however this may sync a bit more than you want. In general you
only want to sync you own data and not cached images or other program information
<p/>
Here is workspace layout in order of importance

<li>magiccards - your decks, collections and copy of magicdb (always sync)</li>
<li>tournaments - data for tournament organizer  (always sync if using)</li>
<li>.backup - data backups (can sync)</li>
<li>.metadata - cached images and app settings (can totally live without it)</li>


<h2>Google Drive</h2>
<li>If you already using MagicAssistant
    <ul>
    <li>Exit the program</li>
    <li>Backup $home/MagicAssistantWorkspace directory</li>
    <li>Move this directory into Google Drive</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Start Magic Assistant, when prompted for workspace select new location at "Google Drive/MagicAssistantWorkspace"</li>

<h2>Version control</h2>
You want to version control your files check in "magiccards" or/and "tournaments" folders.
Folders .backup and .metadata you should put in "ignore" list.
