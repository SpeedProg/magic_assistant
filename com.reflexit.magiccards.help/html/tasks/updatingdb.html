<h1>Updating Database</h1>
By default card database contains only subset of all cards (one of each for the latest edition).
If you want to load other cards you can run an update query which will load cards from Gatherer database.
<p/>
In order to do this go to "Help->Update Magic Card Database...". 
<p/>
<p/>
To update from a particular set select it from the drop down list<br/>
To update for pre-release set type a name in the combo<br/>
To update for latest "released" cards select Standard<br/>
To update all cards select All (do it overnight)<br/>

then click "Update" button
<p/>
<li> Load all versions of art for basic land - Check this option if you want to load all 4 versions of each basic land in a set, otherwise only one would be loaded
<li> Load all printed versions of the same card - For each card in selected set all other printed versions for previous sets would be loaded (same language). 
For example if set has a card "Air Elemental" all of versions of this card would be loaded, so you will see few of them in your database after update.
<p/>

Note: Update database does not update extra fields such as Artist, Rating, etc. To load such field, you need to use Magic DB View.
In the view use appropriate filter, then in view menu select "Load Extra Fields..." command,
select the fields, and select "Update only cards in the filtered list" (or if no filter enabled - update all).
