<h1>Updating Database</h1>
By default card database contains only subset of all cards (one of each for the latest edition).
If you want to load other cards you can run an update query which will load cards from Gatherer database.
<p/>
In order to do this go to "Help->Update Magic Card Database...". 
If you want latest cards use "Standard" as a Set.
If you want different sets, you can change set name in pull down menu. If you don't see you set there
just type it in the box. You have to press "Update Now..." button to do an actual update.
