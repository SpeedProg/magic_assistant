<h1>Updating Database</h1>
By default card database contains only subset of all cards (one of each for the latest edition).
If you want to load other cards you can run an update query which will load cards from Gatherer database.
<p/>
In order to do this go to "Help->Update Magic Card Database...". 
<p/>
<p/>
To update from a particular set select it from the drop down list and click "Update" button.<br/>
To update for pre-release set type a name in the combo box and press "Update".<br/>
To update for latest "released" cards select Standard and press "Update". <br/>
<p/>
<li> Load all versions of art for basic land - Check this option if you want to load all 4 versions of each basic land in a set, otherwise only one would be loaded
<li> Load all printed versions of the same card - For each card in selected set all other printed versions for previous sets would be loaded (same language). 
For example if set has a card "Air Elemental" all of versions of this card would be loaded, so you will see few of them in your database after update.
