(for example ShOTRig) 
until full name is typed or press Enter to cycle through search results.

<h3><a name="filterasic">Basic Filter</h3>

Item that belong to different groups would be selected using logical AND.
<p>

</p>
<p/>

you will get all creates and all enchantments that are Blue or White (including multicolors).
<p/>
