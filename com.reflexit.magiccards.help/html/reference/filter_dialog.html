<h2><a name="filter"/>Filter Dialog</h2>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.

Filter dialog has three page: Basic Filter, Sets Filter and Location filter (last one only available from My Cards view).
 

<h3><a name="filterasic">Basic Filter</h3>
Basic filter has several groups such as Color, Type, Rarity etc.
Items that belong to the same group (such as Type) would be selected using logical OR. 
Item that belong to different groups would be selected using logical AND.
<p>
Color group has two columns - basic colors, and color types and modifiers. Basic colors selected using OR,
unless you check "And". If you check "Only" unchecked colors would be excluded. For example to select Red and Blue Hybrid cards
you need to check Red, Blue, Hybrid and Only (If you don't select Only you will get all hybrids with Red or Blue, for example Blue/White).

</p>
<p/>
Another example: if you select color Blue and White and Type Creature and Enchantment, 
you will get all creates and all enchantments that are Blue or White (including multicolored).
<p/>
Text search fields would split you text by words and search text using AND for all worlds you enter in the same line, disregarding order.
Text search field provide content assist, i.e. they would show possible word you want to enter while you typing.

<p/>To search for symbols in Text field (such as mana and tap symbols) use the following table:
<table>
<tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Search as</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/red_mana.gif"/> Red mana</td><td>{R}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/black_mana.gif"/> Black mana</td><td>{B}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/blue_mana.gif"/> Blue mana</td><td>{U}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/green_mana.gif"/> Green mana</td><td>{G}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/white_mana.gif"/> White mana</td><td>{W}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/tap.gif"/> Tap</td><td>{T}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/untap.gif"/> Untap</td><td>{Q}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/Symbol_1_mana.gif"/> 1 mana</td><td>{1} also {2},{3},...,{12}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/Symbol_BG_mana.gif"/> Black or Green mana</td><td>{B/G} also {W/B},{U/R},...</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/Symbol_RP_mana.gif"/> Phyrexian Red</td><td>{RP} also {WP},{BP},...</td></tr>

</table>
<p/>

You can also search quoted text (will be searched as is including spaces), for example "until end of turn" in double quotes.
If you add "-" right before the word it would mean "not" for example "life -loose", means search for text "life" exclude ones with "loose" in it.
By default text search is case insensitive, if you need case sensitive search or more advanced search you can use regular expressions.
Regular expressions are recognised in text as m/expression/, for example m/Flying/ will search with Flying starting with capital F.
Regular expressions are very powerful, google java regular expression for help on how to write them.
If you put ability in square brackets it will search for minded ability like [draw] will search for cards which allows you 
to draw more cards

<h3><a name="filtersave">Save/Load Filter</a></h3>
This page allows to save existing filter and reuse later, which is handy if you doing same query over and over again.
For example you can select sets which makes current Standard legality and save as "sandard". Or you select all collection
which you own in Location filter (compare to some other ones, like wishlist) and you can quickly load it later to see only own cards.
Or you can create an ability filter and save as "ability" keyword filter.
<p>
Press "Save As..." to save current filter (select an exiting filter to override it).
<p>
Select a filter and press "Load" to load a filter.
<p>
Select a filter and press "Remove" to delete a filter.
