<h2><a name="filter"/>Filter Dialog</h2>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.

Filter dialog has three page: Basic Filter, Sets Filter and Location filter (last one only available from My Cards view).
 

<h3><a name="filterasic">Basic Filter</h3>
Basic filter has several groups such as Color, Type, Rarity etc.
Items that belong to the same group (such as Color) would be selected using logical OR. 
Item that belong to different groups would be selected using logical AND.

<p/>
For example if you select color Blue and White and Type Creature and Enchantment, 
you will get all creates and all enchantments that are Blue or White (including multicolors).
<p/>
Text search fields would split you text by words and search text using AND for all worlds you enter in the same line, disregarding order.
Text search field provide content assist, i.e. they would show possible word you want to enter while you typing.

<p/>To search for symbols in Text field (such as mana and tap symbols) use the following table:
<table>
<tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Search as</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/red_mana.gif"/> Red mana</td><td>{R}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/black_mana.gif"/> Black mana</td><td>{B}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/blue_mana.gif"/> Blue mana</td><td>{U}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/green_mana.gif"/> Green mana</td><td>{G}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/white_mana.gif"/> White mana</td><td>{W}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/tap.gif"/> Tap</td><td>{T}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/untap.gif"/> Untap</td><td>{Q}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/Symbol_1_mana.gif"/> 1 mana</td><td>{1} also {2},{3},...,{12}</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../com.reflexit.magiccards.ui/icons/mana/Symbol_BG_mana.gif"/> Black or Green mana</td><td>{B/G} also {W/B},{U/R},...</td></tr>
</table>
<p/>

You can also search quoted text (will be searched as is including spaces), for example "until end of turn" in double quotes.
If you add "-" right before the word it would mean "not" for example "life -loose", means search for text "life" exclude ones with "loose" in it.
By default text search is case insensitive, if you need case sensitive search or more advanced search you can use regular expressions.
Regular expressions are recognised in text as m/expression/, for example m/Flying/ will search with Flying starting with capital F.


<li>Example 1: Select all Green creatures with flying - Select Green in Color, Create in Type, and type "flying" in Text field</li>
<li>Example 2: Select Artifact Creatures with cost 0 or 1 - Select Artifact in Type, type "Creature" in Type field, select &lt;= 1 in "Converted CC" field.  
<li>Example 3: Select Creatures that can tap for mana - Select "Creature" in Type group, type "{T} mana pool" in Text field.  
<li>Example 4: Look for only Flying creatures - Type "m/Flying/" in the text field, without quotes.
<li>Example 5: Look for creates with no abilities - Select "Creature" in Type group, Type "m/^$/" in the text field, without quotes.
