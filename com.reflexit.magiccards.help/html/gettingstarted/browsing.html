<h1>Browsing Cards</h1>
This is application for browsing "Magic: The Gathering" &#0153; cards 
(see <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic">official website</a>) 
and organising cards into decks and library collections.
<p/>

To browse Magic cards switch to Magic perspective, from Window->Open Perspective.
If you running standalone version this is only perspective available.
<p/>
Magic perspective contains several useful views: 
Card Description, Magic Database, Magic Library and Deck view when decks are open.
Magic Database shows all available cards. By default it will only
show one instance of a card with the same name for the latest edition.
Cards for older editions can be downloaded from the web as well, see updating database section.

<h2>Card Details</h2>
Card details are shown in Card Description view.
It shows card image if available (downloads it from internet), and also shows card name, description and type below the image. 
Click on the card to update this view.

<h2>Sorting</h2>
You can sort by any field by clicking on column header.
If you click again sorting order is reversed.

You also can sort by invisible column, click on view menu (triangle) and select Sort By->Column.

<h2>Filtering</h2>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.

Currently filter dialog has two page: Basic Filter and Sets filter.
 
<p/>
Items that belong to the same group (such as Color) would be selected using logical OR. 
Item that belong to different groups would be selected using logical AND.
<p/>
For example and you select color Blue and White and Type Creature and Enchantment, 
you will get all creates and all enchantments that are Blue or White (including multicolors).

<h2>Search</h2>
You can bring up search control using Ctrl-F key or using view menu "Find...".
It allows you to find a card in the view it is shown (not filtered out).
