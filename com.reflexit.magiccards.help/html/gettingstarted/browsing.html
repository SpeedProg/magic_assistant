<h1>Browsing Cards</h1>

<p/>

To browse Magic cards switch to Magic perspective, from Window->Open Perspective.
If you running standalone version this is only perspective available.
<p/>
Magic perspective contains several useful views: 
Card Description and Magic Database.
Magic Database shows all available cards. By default it will only
show one instance of a card with the same name for the latest edition.
Cards for older editions can be downloaded from the web as well, see updating database section.

<h2>Card Details</h2>

<h2>Sorting</h2>
You can sort by any field by clicking on column header.
If you click again sorting order is reversed.

You also can sort by invisible column, click on view menu (triangle) and select Sort By->Column.

<h2>Filtering</h2>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.

Currently filter dialog has two page: Basic Filter and Sets filter.
 
<p/>
Items that belong to the same group (such as Color) would be selected using logical OR. 
Item that belong to different groups would be selected using logical AND.
<p/>
For example and you select color Blue and White and Type Creature and Enchantment, 
you will get all creates and all enchantments that are Blue or White (including multicolors).
