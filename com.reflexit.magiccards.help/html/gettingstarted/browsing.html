<h1>Browsing Cards</h1>
This is application for browsing "Magic: The Gathering" &#0153; cards 
(see <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic">official website</a>) 
and organising cards into decks and library collections.
<p/>

To browse Magic cards switch to Magic perspective, from Window->Open Perspective.
If you running standalone version this is only perspective available.
<p/>
Magic perspective contains several useful views: 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info</a>, 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewcardnav">Card Navigator</a>, 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewmagicdb">MTG Database</a>, 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewcol">My Cards View</a> and 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewdeck">Deck view</a> when decks are open.
MTG Database View shows all available cards. By default it will only
show one instance of a card with the same name for the latest edition.
Cards for older editions can be downloaded from the internet, see updating database section.

<h2>Card Info</h2>
Card details are shown in Card Info view.
It shows card image if available (downloads it from internet), and also shows card name, description and type below the image. 
Click on the card in any tables to see card info in this view. See more details in <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info View</a> 
reference.

<h2>Sorting</h2>
You can sort by any field by clicking on column header in the views that display card tables.
If you click again sorting order is reversed.

You also can sort by invisible column, click on view menu (triangle) and select Sort By->Column.

<h2>Filtering</h2>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.

Currently filter dialog has the following pages: Basic Filter, Sets Filter and Location filter (only for My Card view).
 
<p/>
Items that belong to the same group (such as Color) would be selected using logical OR. 
Items that belong to different groups would be selected using logical AND.
<p/>
For example and you select colour Blue and White and Type Creature and Enchantment, 
you will get all creatures and all enchantments that are Blue or White (including multicolors).

<h2>Search</h2>
You can bring up search control using Ctrl-F key or using view menu "Find...".
It allows you to find a card in the view it is shown (not filtered out). 
Found card will be automatically selected. 
You can use "case sensitive search" option and "whole word" option.
If you type first letter of each work in a card name in uppercase it will also find matches,
for example if you type "ESMB" it should match with "Endrek Sahr, Master Breeder". 

<h2>Other Actions</h2>
Some other actions available from context menu (right click) or from view menu (triangle button in the view header).
You can changes layout of you views but dragging them around by header. If you get lost you can reset to original layout using
