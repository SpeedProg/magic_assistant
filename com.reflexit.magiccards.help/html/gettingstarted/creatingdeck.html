<h1>Creating and Populating a Deck</h1>

<h2>Create a new Deck</h2>
First create a deck in the Card Navigator. 
<li>Open a Card Navigator view, by clicking on the header.</li>
<li>Find Deck folder and right click on it.</li> 
<li>Select New...-&gt; Deck from the context menu.</li>
<li>Type a name in the Name field. Click Finish. </li>

Deck will be automatically open.

<h2>Populate a deck from printed cards</h2>
<p/>
Now to populate a deck open MTG Database view.
If your deck is made from limited number of sets, it is better to select them in the filter,
to simplify the search. To do that click on Filter button on the view header (Or select Filter... from view or context menu),
switch to Set Filter on the left and select one or more sets.
<p/>
Now type Ctrl-F or select Find... from the view menu (triangle button in the view header). <a href="../reference/views.html#search">Search panel</a> will be open.
<p/>
Bring up Card Info view to see results of your search.
<p/>
Type name of card in the search field, you don't have to type whole name, search would show up cards as you type. 
As soon as you see your card in Card Info view press "+" button. Card will be added to your deck.
If card name consists of several words, you can type only first letters of each word in capital letters, for example
to find "Shield of the Righteous" type SOTR in the search field. If it is not your card you can keep typing until full name
is typed or press Enter to cycle through search results. 
<p/>
If your cards were sorted by name already you can either type + several times to achieve needed number, or double click on
card in the deck and edit count of cards directly. You also can edit count in the Count cell itself.

<h2>Populate a deck using text import</h2>
If you have a deck contents in electronic form you import it using Deck import.
Select a new empty deck and select Import... from a context menu (right click menu).
