<h1>Updating Database</h1>
By default card database contains only subset of all cards (one of each for the latest edition).
If you want to load other cards you can run an update query which will load cards from Gatherer database.
<p/>
In order to do this go to Window->Preferences... Select Magic->Gatherer preferences
and click Update button. But default it will update cards for current Standard set.
If you want different sets, you can change set name in the query parameters.
