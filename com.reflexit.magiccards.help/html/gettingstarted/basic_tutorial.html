<h1>Basic Tutorial</h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>
Magic Assistant is application for browsing "Magic: The Gathering" &#0153; cards 
(see <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic">official website</a>) 
and organising cards into decks and library collections.
<p/>
To start playing with Magic Assistant if you using it as eclipse plugin 
switch to Magic perspective, from Window->Open Perspective.
<p/>
If you running standalone version this is only perspective available.
<p/>

Magic perspective contains several views: <br/>
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewmagicdb">MTG Database</a> - To browse existing mtg cards, <br/> 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info</a> - To view detailed card information and picture,<br/> 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewcardnav">Card Navigator</a> - To browse your own decks and collections, <br/> 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewcol">My Cards View</a> - To browse All Your personal cards, and <br/> 
<a href="../reference/views.html#viewdeck">Deck view</a>s - To look at the cards in each deck.
<p/>

You can changes layout of your views but dragging them around by the header. If you get lost you can reset to original layout using 
menu "Window-&gt;Reset Perspective...".
<p/>
If you are not familiar with eclipse please note that some actions are available from the "view menu", this is
small triangle at the top right corner of each view. Context sensitive actions are available from context menu, which
is invoked by "mouse right click".

<p/>

MTG Database View shows all available cards. By default it will only
show one instance of a card with the same name for the latest edition.
Cards for older editions can be downloaded from the internet, see <a href="../tasks/updatingdb.html">updating database</a> section.
<p/>
Card details and scanned card picture are shown in the <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info</a> view.
It shows card image if available (downloads it from internet), and also shows card name, description and type below the image. 
Click on the card in any of the tables to see card info in this view. See more details in <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info View</a> 
reference.

<h2> Browsing and Searching </h2>
To browse cards you can use sorting and filtering: 
<p/>
You can sort by any column by clicking on the column header in the views that display card tables.
If you click again sorting order is reversed. You can also see more columns, control is available from "Preferences..."
menu of the view menu <img src="../screenshots/icons/view_menu.gif" alt="triangle button"/>.
<p/>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.
See details in 
<a href="../reference/filter_dialog.html">Filter Dialog</a> reference.

<p>
You can bring up search control using Ctrl-F key or using view menu "Find...".
It allows you to find a card in the view by name (or part of name). 
See details in 
<a href="../reference/search_bar.html">Search Bar</a> reference.
<h2> Building a deck </h2>
To build a deck you need <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcardnav">Card Navigator</a> view,
from there you can add a new deck and place it in the desired folder. After deck is created you can populate
it by moving cards from database or from other decks or collection, or using deck import.
See more details in <a href="../tasks/creatingdeck.html">Creating and Populating a Deck or Collection</a>.
<p/>
You can edit cards in your decks and collections. To edit card properties you can select or more cards from the
table and choose "Edit..." from context menu (or double click on a card). Editable card properties currently are:
 count, comment, ownership and price.
<p/>
You can analyse you deck using some tools: Mana Curve, Colors, Card Types - these are tabs at the bottom of the
deck view. Also you can group cards to achieve same statistics in the main table tab using Group By menu (from the view menu).

Mana Curve - shows chart of your deck mana curve (number of cards vs cost) for spells (land is not there).
Average bars - is normal distribution of cards in average deck adjusted to number of cards in your deck (hardcoded in program, it is not based on your decks) . 

<h2> Other stuff </h2>
Some other actions available from main menu, context menu (right click) or from view menu (triangle button in the view header  <img src="../screenshots/icons/view_menu.gif" alt="triangle button"/>).
