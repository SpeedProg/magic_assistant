<h2> Overview </h2>

card - magic card; <br/>
card printing - abstract representation of printed card, contains card properties such as name, type, rating etc.;<br/>
card instance - concrete representation of card, has reference to printing, but also has additional properties such as count, 
comment, special tags (foil, online, mint condition, fortrade, etc);<br/>
collection - set of magic cards stored in a specific location or virtually grouped;<br/>
deck - specialized collection which is designed for play (when application refers to term collection it usually means both deck or 
non-deck collection);<br/>
own card - card that you own physically or online;<br/>
virtual card - card you don't own, but want to play with, by creating virtual decks or wishlists;<br/>
card pile - representation of card instances in a single element, with count, pile can be split if you need to move individual cards around;<br/>
card database - set of card printings cashed locally representing all cards that app knows about (usually synced with "Gatherer" web site)
  
<p/>

<a href="../reference/views.html#viewcollector">Collector</a> - View of your personal cards with fields and grouping relevant to card collector, rather than player <br/>  
<p/>

You can changes layout of your views but dragging them around by the header. If you get lost you can reset to original layout using 
menu "Window-&gt;Reset Perspective...".
<p/>
If you are not familiar with eclipse please note that some actions are available from the "view menu", this is
small triangle at the top right corner of each view. Context sensitive actions are available from context menu, which
is invoked by "mouse right click" on windows and linux.

<h2>Updating Magic Card Database Online</h2>

MTG Database View shows all available cards. By default it will only
show cards witch pre-loaded with application. It can quickly be out of date, 
to keep database in sync you have to perform cards updates. 
App will check for update automatically on startup (unless you turned it off).

To update cards manually, see <a href="../tasks/updatingdb.html">updating database</a> section.
Cards are updated from the official magic maker website called Gatherer <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com">http://gatherer.wizards.com</a>.
If you see something wrong with database info please check this website first and report issues to them.
For sets they don't have, there is a complicated procedure of how you can extend database manually, 
check the end of <a href="../tasks/updatingdb.html">updating database</a> section or  ask on forum.


<h2>Browsing and Searching </h2>
To browse cards you can use grouping,  sorting and filtering: 
<p/>
You can sort by any column by clicking on the column header in the views that display card tables.
If you click again sorting order is reversed. You can also see more columns, control is available from "Preferences..."
menu of the view menu <img src="../screenshots/icons/view_menu.gif" alt="triangle button"/>.
You can also sort cards by column which is not currently visible using sorting menu.
<p/>
You can filter cards in the view by opening filter. Filter action is on view toolbar and also available from the view menu.
You can select one of more criteria from the filters.
See details in 
<a href="../reference/filter_dialog.html">Filter Dialog</a> reference.
You can also filter cards by name, type and colour using quick filter - the bar on top of card tables.
Grouping is also available from the action bar of view menu, there is few fields and field combination you can group by.

<p>
You can bring up search control using Ctrl-F key or using view menu "Find...".
It allows you to find a card in the view by name (or part of name). Comparing to filter it does not remove the cards from
the list.
See details in 
<a href="../reference/search_bar.html">Search Bar</a> reference.
<p/>
Card details and scanned card picture are shown in the <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info</a> view.
It shows card image if available (downloads it from internet), and also shows card name, description and type below the image. 
Click on the card in any of the tables to see card info in this view. See more details in <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcard">Card Info View</a> 
reference.
<h2> Building a deck </h2>
To build a deck you need <a href="../reference/views.html#viewcardnav">Card Navigator</a> view,
from there you can add a new deck and place it in the desired folder. After deck is created you can populate
it by moving cards from database or from other decks or collection, or using deck Import.
When moving own card from collection to deck, the location changes. If you prefer just to
create virtual decks, create deck with virtual flag and use copy drag instead.
See more details in <a href="../tasks/creatingdeck.html">Creating and Populating a Deck or Collection</a>.
<p/>
You can edit cards in your decks and collections. To edit card properties you can select one or more cards from the
table and choose "Edit..." from context menu (or double click on a card). Editable card properties currently are:
 count, comment, ownership and price.
<p/>
You can analyse you deck using some tools: Mana Curve, Colors, Card Types, Draw, Legality - these are tabs at the bottom of the
deck view. Also you can group cards to achieve same statistics in the main table tab using Group By menu (from the view menu).

<br>
Mana Curve - shows chart of your deck mana curve (number of cards vs cost) for spells (land is not there).
Average bars - is normal distribution of cards in average deck adjusted to number of cards in your deck (hardcoded in program, it is not based on your decks) . 
<br>
If you have sideboard it is stored in the separate list. To bring it up use Open Sideboard action from toolbar or view menu of Deck view.
Drag and drop cards to sideboard from other sources same as for main deck. If you want to see sideboard and main deck at 
the same time drag sideboard view to the bottom (and have main on the top). Sideboard is linked the the main deck, tabs like Legality and Export
are also looking at sideboard cards (while tabs like Mana Curve don't). Operations like deck Rename or Delete will also affect its sideboard.

<h2> Storage and Internet </h2>

All data is stored in directory called "workspace" (conceptually, the real name is whatever you named it). When app first
starts it will ask where your workspace is. You only need one workspace. 
Don't put it inside installation dir - that can create problems with software update and upgrade. Decks and Collection as well as database itself
are stored in xml format, means you can edit it in editor if you really wish. All card images and set images are loaded
from internet and cached in workspace as well. If you choose to do so you can work offline, controlled by settings. If you behind firewall there
are settings to allow a redirect proxy. 
<br><br>
If you want to host your decks on the cloud you can do so by enabling syncronization of your workspace or its subfolders
into the cloud storage such as box, dropbox, google drive, etc. Syncing whole workspace is probably a not a good idea since it 
contains cached images which would take majority of the space. Next option is to sync workspace/magiccards folder which
is all your cards and database. See <a href="../tasks/sync.html">Setting up cloud sync or version control</a>
for more details. 

<br><br>
It is recommended to backup your data once in a while by zipping contents of magiccards folder.
You can also use File->Backup action that does that.
<br><br>
If you have issues with software you can send a bug Help->Send Bug or Feature Request and attach the log file
found at workspace/.metadata/.log if this is a bug.


<h2> Other stuff </h2>
Some other actions available from main menu, context menu (right click) or from view menu (triangle button in the view header  <img src="../screenshots/icons/view_menu.gif" alt="triangle button"/>).
