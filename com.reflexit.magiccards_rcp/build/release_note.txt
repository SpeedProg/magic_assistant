This is alpha release of Magic Assistant 1.4.3,
I switched platform to eclipse 4.5 (Mars) and I switched to a new build system
so resulting artifacts may contain lots of bugs. Appreciate any help testing especially
on mac os. Please backup you cards or use a different workspace to test it.
Thanks!
