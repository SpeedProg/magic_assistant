This is alpha release of Magic Assistant 1.5.0,
I switched platform to eclipse 4.5 (Mars) and I switched to a new build system
so resulting artifacts may contain lots of bugs. Appreciate any help testing especially
on mac os. Please backup you cards or use a different workspace to test it.
Thanks!

* If it does not start it picked wrong java, see installation notes below
* On Mac OS if you double click on application it may say it is damaged, don't believe it, run it from command line instead.
