== Installing from p2repo ==

This is not a full installer, you need to download and install application itself first

Note: you don't need this if update site works, this is replacement
technique to get updates published on update site if connection is not great.

# Download http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtgbrowser/files/Patches/p2repo.zip
# Unzip it in the root of installation for example, it will have root directory p2repo
# Window->Preferences->Magic Preferences click on Add Software Update Site... 
# Click Local... and select <where you unzipped it>/p2repo. Click OK.
# In the name field type something like "Local Repo". Exit preferences
# Click File->Check for Software Updates

Now it be updating from local disk.
